# cake-factory

In this liveProject you will help create an e-commerce web application for a company called “Cake Factory.” It is a small, independent bakery located in North London which focuses on high-quality bread and pastries with quick delivery to local residents (within 30 minutes). The founder of the bakery has a simple idea for her business: people want high-quality pastries and bread delivered for breakfast or lunch, but they don’t have enough time to go pick them up.
